/*Part One
Create a class for vehicle. Each vehicle instance should have the following properties:

make
model
year
Each vehicle instance should have access to a method called honk, which returns the string “Beep.” */

let myFirstVehicle = new Vehicle("Honda", "Monster Truck", 1999);
myFirstVehicle.honk(); // "Beep."

/*Each vehicle instance should have a method called toString, which returns the string containing the make, model and year. */

let myFirstVehicle = new Vehicle("Honda", "Monster Truck", 1999);
myFirstVehicle.toString(); // "The vehicle is a Honda Monster Truck from 1999."

class Vehicle {
        constructor(make, model, year) {
            this.make = make
            this.model = model

        toString() {
            return `The vehicle is a ${this.make} ${this.model} from ${this.year}`

}

/*Part Two
Create a class for a car. The Car class should inherit from Vehicle and each car instance should have a property called numWheels which has a value of 4. */

let myFirstCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2005);
myFirstCar.toString(); // "The vehicle is a Toyota Corolla from 2005."
myFirstCar.honk();     // "Beep."
myFirstCar.numWheels;  // 4

class Car extends Vehicle {
    constructor(make, model, year) {
        super(make, model, year)
        this.numWheels = 4
    }
}

/*Part Three
Create a class for a Motorcycle. This class should inherit from Vehicle and each motorcycle instance should have a property called numWheels which has a value of 2. It should also have a revEngine method which returns “VROOM!!!”*/

let myFirstMotorcycle = new Motorcycle("Honda", "Nighthawk", 2000);

myFirstMotorcycle.toString();
// "The vehicle is a Honda Nighthawk from 2000."

myFirstMotorcycle.honk();     // "Beep."
myFirstMotorcycle.revEngine(); // "VROOM!!!"
myFirstMotorcycle.numWheels;  // 2

class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
    constructor(make, model, year) {
        super(make, model, year)
        this.numWheels = 2
    }
    revEngine() {
        return 'VROOM!!!'
    }
}

/*Part Four
Create a class for a Garage. It should have a property called vehicles which will store an array of vehicles, and a property called capacity which is a number indicating how many vehicles will fit in the garage. When you create a garage, vehicles will always be empty; you only need to provide the capacity.

A garage should also have an add method, which attempts to add a vehicle to the array of vehicles. However, if you try to add something which is not a vehicle, the garage should return the message “Only vehicles are allowed in here!”. Also, if the garage is at capacity, it should say “Sorry, we’re full.” */

let garage = new Garage(2);
garage.vehicles; // []
garage.add(new Car("Hyundai", "Elantra", 2015)); // "Vehicle added!"
garage.vehicles; // [Car]
garage.add("Taco"); // "Only vehicles are allowed in here!"

garage.add(new Motorcycle("Honda", "Nighthawk", 2000));
// "Vehicle added!"
garage.vehicles; // [Car, Motorcycle]

garage.add(new Motorcycle("Honda", "Nighthawk", 2001));
// "Sorry, we're full."

class Garage {
    constructor(capacity) {
        this.vehicles = []
        this.capacity = capacity 
    }
    add(addVehicle) {
        if(this.vehicles.length >= this.capacity) {
            throw new Error("Sorry, we're full.") 
        }
        if(!(addVehicle instanceof Vehicle)) {
            throw new Error("Only vehicles are allowed in here!")
        }
        this.vehicles.push(addVehicle)
            return 'Vehicle added!'
    }
